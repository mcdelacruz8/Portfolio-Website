# Portfolio Website Notes

A little bit of code and test...
## HTML 
1. Imported .css & .js files 
2. Imported "Font Awesome" cdnjs library
3. Started making the sidebar feature
4. Used "section" instead of "div" bc the content is all relative to each other. Think chapters in a book instead of a division in the html page
5. Started style.css code
------
9. Started Home Section
10. 





## CSS
6. Used the var() function to insert serval CSS variables
7. Set my bases to hold everything with the "body" and "*" tags
8. "::before" inserts something before the content of selected tag, "::after" inserts after the content





## JS
